This model helps hotels predict whether a booking might get canceled before the guest even arrives, so they can plan ahead and avoid losing money on empty rooms. Itâ€™s built using real reservation data from a city hotel and a resort hotel in Portugal between 2015 and 2017, including useful details like how early the booking was made, what type of hotel and deposit were chosen, and some guest history. 
By looking at these patterns with a Random Forest Classifier, the model can spot which bookings are more likely to get canceled, and it does this pretty accurately with about accuracy with a  0.827. Hotel managers and booking staff can use this to tweak overbooking levels, manage room availability better, and even reach out to guests who might cancel. To make this easy, the model can be shared as a simple web page or dashboard where staff just enter booking info and instantly see the risk score with no technical skills needed.
